## Assignment 1: Prototype and Pitch

For the first sprint, students divide into two-person teams (possibly with 1- or 3-person exceptions allowed).

This sprint is used to develop a design documents, a prototype, and a pitch. At the end of the sprint, teams pitch their project idea to the class.

Deliverables:

* Prototype software in GitHub. README: license, authors, vision, status, installation and run. The intent of the prototype is to assess the project difficulty. It should either integrate with a data source or hardware component; or prototype a key algorithm or user interface presentation component.
* Design documents in GitHub. Requirements, features, dependencies, system architecture, development plan, MVP, stretch goals.
* Presentation. This should include a project name, the project vision, and draw from the design documents. It can include screenshots or screencasts from the running software; a sampler from similar projects that already exists; or mocked illustrations or videos.
